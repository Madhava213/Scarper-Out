                    <p class="py-6">
                        Scarper Out is an interactive game where the player has
                        to reach the end goal by navigating a randomly generated
                        maze. The maze contains three different powerups which
                        help the player reach the goal. The lighting powerup
                        increases the lighting for the player, the speed powerup
                        increases the speed of the player, and the path finding
                        power up shows a path from the player location to the
                        end goal. The maze also contains monsters that move
                        towards the player if it sees the player. If a player
                        collides with a monster then the player gets teleported
                        to a random location in the maze.

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5">Recursive Backtracking</h2>
                    <p class="py-6">
                        We chose recursive backtracking for our maze generation
                        since it allows for an easy, fast, and simple
                        implementation for a maze generating algorithm. In this
                        algorithm, a 2-dimensional grid of cell objects is used
                        to indicate the position of the walls. Starting from a
                        random point in the grid, a random adjacent cell in a
                        cardinal direction is visited and added to a stack. If
                        all adjacent cells have been visited then that cell is
                        removed from the stack. This process is repeated till
                        only the starting cell is left in the stack. While this
                        algorithm is fast, its biggest bottleneck is that it
                        requires a lot of memory for the stack. So for really
                        large mazes this algorithm is inefficient, and would be
                        a big limiting factor if we were to scale up the size of
                        the maze.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5">A-Star</h2>
                    <p class="py-6">
                        We used a modified pathfinding algorithm called A\*
                        Algorithm to implement the Path Finding PowerUp. This
                        algorithm takes a few seconds to process the path
                        towards the goal for the player based on the soze of the
                        maze/map which seems to be one of the biggest drawbacks
                        of the algorithm. On the contrary, it provides us with
                        an efficient path for the player to reach the goal.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold pb-5">Particle System</h2>
                    <p class="py-6">
                        We are using Unity's built in particle system which
                        allows us to create a random controlled spread of
                        particles using various sprites. Specifically, we are
                        using it to generate the subtle fire particles of the
                        monsters which will chase the player. This fire particle
                        system was adapted using a free asset from the Unity
                        asset store that is referenced in the 'References"
                        section below.

                    <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold pb-5">Gameplay Design</h1>
                    <p class="py-6">We chose to go with a dark and horroresque
                        theme, so most of our animations and design choices
                        complement this. We chose to use dark materials for the
                        maze walls and narrowed the field of view of the player
                        to better go with the theme of the game. We also chose
                        to animate the monsters based on the gameplay designs.
                        Our monsters move when it sees the player and to
                        indicate this movement we used particle systems to
                        animate fire around the monster. Also it takes less
                        power to render since the particle system is only on
                        when the monster is moving towards the player. We also
                        used A-Star to for pathfinding when the player picks up
                        the pathfinding power up. We chose to use A-Star since
                        it is complete and optimal. This is useful because the
                        maze has at least one solution from the player position
                        to the end goal which the A-Star will find since it is
                        complete. Also since A-Star is optimal it will find the
                        shortest path to the goal, this way the player will be
                        able to reach the goal in the shortest amount of time.</p>

                    <p class="py-6">
                        Our initial idea was for Scarper Out was to create a
                        maze game and have obstacles that the user will have
                        to
                        get past to reach the goal. We decided to make the
                        obstacles monsters that chased and attacked the
                        player.
                        We also wanted to use power-ups to help the players
                        defeat the monsters, but later on decided against
                        it.
                        Instead we decided to have the monsters teleport the
                        player to a random location in the maze, and
                        designed
                        the powerups so that it will help the player get to
                        the
                        goal faster. This way it made the game more focused
                        on
                        solving the maze than fighting the monsters.

                        Once we got the basic design for the
                        game,
                        we
                        started
                        implementation of the different
                        elements.
                        First
                        we
                        created the maze using recursive
                        backtracking.
                        Once the
                        maze generation algorithms worked, we
                        had to
                        place nodes
                        along the path so that we could use
                        A-Star
                        to
                        find the
                        best path to the goal. Originally we
                        thought
                        this was
                        going to be easy, however since the maze
                        algorithm only
                        places the walls and doesn't actually
                        create
                        a
                        path, we
                        had to use the grid positions in Unity
                        to
                        place
                        the
                        nodes along the path. Once the nodes
                        were
                        placed
                        we were
                        able to adapt the A-Star algorithm (Add
                        difficulties
                        with A-Star). The other power-ups were
                        fairly
                        straightforward to implement. Also in
                        order
                        to
                        make
                        solving the maze easier we decided to
                        add a
                        star
                        indicator above the end goal in order to
                        help
                        guide the
                        player to the end.

                        to
                        improve the game. First we increased our

                        of view
                        since originally it was a bit narrow and

                        Second we
                        added sound effects for footsteps, item
                        pick-up,
                        and
                        background. These sound effects greatly
                        improved
                        the
                        immersiveness of the game.

                        A lot of the techniques we used were fairly new and
                        state of the art algorithms and techniques, some of
                        which we discussed in class. For example, in Unity we
                        used raycasting to check if a monster can see the
                        player. Unity's raycasting uses spatial search to check
                        if objects will intersect. Unity casts the ray from the
                        object to the bounding box of the collider to check for
                        collisions.

                    <p class="py-6">
                        Our game can be extended and improved in multiple ways.
                        The biggest improvement will be using a better
                        pathfinding algorithm, since A-Star is very slow as the
                        maze gets larger. Given more time we could implement
                        faster algorithms to find a path to the goal. We could
                        also use fewer nodes by placing the nodes in
                        intersections of the maze. This will allow for the
                        A-star algorithm to run faster since there will be fewer
                        nodes to check. Improving the pathfinding will also
                        allow for us to create larger mazes, which will then
                        allow us to create more unique powerups and monsters to
                        make the game more interesting.
